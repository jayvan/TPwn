# Tetris Bot
This is a bot for Tetris written in C#. It works by looking at the next piece and simulating every possible move. Each outcome is scored, and the best possible move is taken in a matter of milliseconds.
## Todo List
* Implement logic for battle mode (combos, tetrises) in addition to sprint mode
* Look ahead a number of moves to find better moves
