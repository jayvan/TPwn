# Tetris Bot
This is a bot for Tetris written in C#. It works by looking at the next piece and simulating every possible move. Each outcome is scored, and the best possible move is done.
As a nifty proof that it works, I've added some AutoItX code that reads the board and next piece from Tetris Friends and sends keystrokes to do the best move (a tetris bot). 
## Todo List
* Separate the logic from the automation to have a "Tetris Library"
* Improve the scoring algorithm
* Implement logic for battle mode (combos, tetrises) in addition to sprint mode
